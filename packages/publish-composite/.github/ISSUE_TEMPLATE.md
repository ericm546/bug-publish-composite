Hi there! Before you open an issue, please check if a similar issue already exists or has been closed before.

When reporting a bug, please be sure to include the following:
* A descriptive title
* What version of Meteor you're using, and the platform(s) you're running it on
* The behavior you expect to see, and the actual behavior
* The smallest amount of code that will reproduce the behavior. The best way to do this is to create a GitHub repository that can be cloned and run with no modification. This is extremely helpful and will get you the fastest response.
